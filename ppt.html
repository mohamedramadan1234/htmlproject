      <h1>Multi-Tasking/Time-sharing Operating systems</h1>
<p>Time-sharing operating system enables people located at a different terminal(shell) to use a single computer system at the same time. The processor time (CPU) which is shared among multiple users is termed as time sharing.</p>
      <h1>Real time OS</h1>
<p>A real time operating system time interval to process and respond to inputs is very small. Examples: Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems are the Real time OS example.</p>
      <h1>Distributed Operating System</h1>
      <p>Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation to its users.</p>
      <h1>Network Operating System</h1>
      <p>Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to serve to manage data, user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.

    </p>
      <h1>Mobile OS
    </h1>
      
      <p>Mobile operating systems are those OS which is especially that are designed to power smartphones, tablets, and wearables devices.</p>
      
      <p>Some most famous mobile operating systems are Android and iOS, but others include BlackBerry, Web, and watchOS.</p>
     <h1>In an operating system software performs each of the function:

    </h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Process management:- Process management helps OS to create and delete processes. It also provides mechanisms for synchronization and communication among processes.
        </li>
        <li>Memory management:- Memory management module performs the task of allocation and de-allocation of memory space to programs in need of this resources.
        </li>
        <li>File management:- It manages all the file-related activities such as organization storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files.
        </li>
        <li>Device Management: Device management keeps tracks of all devices. This module also responsible for this task is known as the I/O controller. It also performs the task of allocation and de-allocation of the devices.
        </li>
        <li>I/O System Management: One of the main objects of any OS is to hide the peculiarities of that hardware devices from the user.
        </li>
        <li>Secondary-Storage Management: Systems have several levels of storage which includes primary storage, secondary storage, and cache storage. Instructions and data must be stored in primary storage or cache so that a running program can reference it.
        </li>
        <li>Security:- Security module protects the data and information of a computer system against malware threat and authorized access.
        </li>
        <li>Command interpretation: This module is interpreting commands given by the and acting system resources to process that commands.
        </li>
        <li>Networking: A distributed system is a group of processors which do not share memory, hardware devices, or a clock. The processors communicate with one another through the network.
        </li>
        <li>Job accounting: Keeping track of time & resource used by various job and users.
        </li>
        <li>Communication management: Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, and another software resource of the various users of the computer systems.
        </li>
        
      </ol>
